## **About Me**
### **As a person...**
Hello, My name is *Rena* and I am a student from *University Of California, San Diego* <sub>(UCSD)</sub>. My major is *Computer Science* and I enjoy coding in C++ and Python. I like milk tea a lot and I will watch horror movie in the free time. Currently, I favourite movie is "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre".


### **As a programmer...**
I created logo maker, bouncing ball simulator and basic calculator via C++ in the past. Currently, I am trying to learn new algorithm and write more effective program in the future. I also wrote some sample website via HTML and CSS but I am not good at javaScript. 


One of the website I created with my team is [Animal Shelter](https://summer22-sps-24.appspot.com/)

Some basic HTML command of this project are: 
```
